	\section{Purpose of the Project}
	The purpose of this project is to produce the game designed by the team: Mech-APEX Zero. Mech-APEX Zero is the combination of classical 2D games like Metroid, Castlevania, and Street Fighter. This game will reinvigorate the love for such classics and the modern spin of new combat mechanics will attract new players.
	
	\subsection{Background}
	The concept of this game was conceived to revitalize a very saturated genre of video games: Platformer. Currently on Steam, new releases of the Platformer Genre has 1167 results. The motivation of the team is to make a game that would stand out amongst the over one thousand competitors. In order to achieve our goal, we have examined the classics and commercial successes to create our project.
	
	\subsection{Goals}
	The goals of Team Chicken Sausage is to produce an entertaining game to satisfies the needs of our clients. We want our audience to get the enjoyment of playing a platformer and to be dazzled and surprised by our creative story and universe.
	
	\section{Stakeholders}
	\subsection{Development Team} Chicken and Sausages. 
	\subsection{Instructor} Dr. Jacques Carette  
	\subsection{Game Critics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dr. Jacques Carette
		\item Daniel Szymczak
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Player} The players who enjoy platformers and beat em up games. 
	
	\section{Mandated Constraints}
	The game must have a certain degree of complexity attached to it, as required from Dr. Carrete, to gauge the students game development abilities better. This complexity goes hand in hand with the difficulty of developing the game as it is very easy to make tic tac toe compared to a game such as Skyrim. 
	
	\subsection{Solution Constraints}
	Project must use Unity Game Engine to develop the game. The main programming language used will be C\#. 
	
	\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
	The final product will be able to run on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems, as the Unity library allows to build project for all three platforms.
	Due to the nature of the game being a combo focused action platformer, control methods such as mouse control or touch screen will not be ideal. The development team will focus its effort on establishing keyboard as the main method of controls. Controllers such as Dualshock 4 and Xbox Controller are options, but do not have plans to implement these currently.
	
	\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
	The product of this project will comply with all policies of the Unity Free User's Licence Agreement.
	This product will not be used for commercial purposes as the assets used were of other Games.
	
	\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
	Some assets used in this project is created through the use of GIMP. The final product shall comply with GIMP's user agreement.
	
	\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
	The deadline of the Project must be within the 2017-2018 Capstone Course terms. Revision 0 of the product must be completed by December of 2017.
	
	\subsection{Budget Constraints}
	No funding for the project will be provided. Any expenses that occur will be paid individually

	\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
	\subsection{Relevant Facts}
	The game will follow the standard RPG progression where the player starts with the barebones necessary to complete the initial levels and will be rewarded with better armor/weapons/upgrades as they progress. The player can also scavenge for better loot.
	As with most games that utilize combos; combos that do more damage will require more keys to be pressed.
	\subsection{Assumptions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The player meets minimum hardware requirements to run the game. 
		\item The player is running the latest version of Windows or macOS.
		\item The player is familiar with a mouse and keyboard setup. 
		\item The player is able-bodied. 
		\item The player has enough dexterity to hit multiple keys in quick succession to perform combos.
		\item The user can read english.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{The Scope of the Work}
	\subsection{Existing Inspirations}
	The biggest inspiration for this project is the Metroid and Castlevania franchises. The cohesive aesthetics and level design are areas that this project will attempt to achieve the same level of competence as the classics of this Genre. The fighting mechanics of Super Smash Bros Franchise will be used to inspire the combat mechanics of this game to introduce new elements of the old platformer formula.
	\subsection{Context of the Work}
	The player should be motivated by the story, gameplay, and the gameplay rewards. In order to know what happens next, the player must play through the levels. The player can unlock achievements and other Mobile Suits through playing the game.
	
	\section{The Scope of the Product}
	\subsection{Product Boundary}
	Project boundaries identify what should be included in the project as well as what should not be included.\\
	
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{product-boundary.png} \\
	
	At the current state of the project, the focus will be to complete the fighting mechanic, various character sprite movesets, level design, and Story. Implementing elements of RPG should not be worked on at this time, when the core mechanics are not functional. Features such as combo meter, score system, achievements, and unlockables should be be focused on at later dates if enough development time is available.

	\section{Project Schedule}
	The project will follow the guide up on the courses webpage. The work will be done before the deadline of every task set up by Dr. Carette.\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Main Character Sprite Animation: Nov 3
		\item Character Sprite Animation: Nov 10
		\item Behaviour of Enemies: Nov 4
		\item Button Mapping and Hitbox set up: Nov 17
		\item Level Design and Platform set up: Nov 24
		\item Finalization and Testing: Dec 1
	\end{itemize}
	Schedule subject to change based on progress.
	
	\section{Risks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The product demands a large portion of time and commitment, once the project has been started, future commitments and opportunity are now lost.
		\item If the game is a massive hit with the community  there could be potential copyright claims.
		\item if the project isn’t implement up to standard than our course grade will be affected 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Costs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The entire product will be funded by team. As of now the free version of Unity is being utilized coupled with free, open-source assets. In the future we might have to buy certain assets that fit the theme of the game better. The financial costs will be limited to purchases of assets.  
		\item The game should be completed by the end of April 2018. Considering the level design, multiple playable characters, multiple weapons, combo based attacks which require a unique animation the game will take entire alloted time to complete. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{User Documentation and Training}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User Documentation Requirements.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game will include a user manual outlining all basic movement controls, basic attacks, environment interaction keys, and all combos included in the game. This manual can be accessed by the start menu and the pause menu.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Training Requirements
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game will be very easy to learn and understand, accordingly we intend for the player to learn as they go. They should be familiar with the the basic movement and attacking commands within the completion of the first level of the game. We encourage player autonomy therefore the player can learn which ever combos they wish to use by looking them up in the user manual. As of now we do not intend to put in a standalone training level before the game actually starts. 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Waiting List}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Expansions to the game introducing new weapons and even more combos.(PUC No.8)
		\item Achievement list(PUC No.22)
		\item Mobile suit upgrade and Gundam Maintenance(PUC No.28)
		\item Interact with Gundam Gear(PUC No.19)
		\item Use items and items pick up(PUC No.3)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Ideas for Solution}
	Enemy Ai is very large and difficult problem within many games. There are many ways in order to implement the ai within the game and here are some ideas. The first idea, that will apply to many enemies,  is to have  the Ai constantly grab the location of the player’s avatar and a add force in the direction of the player, if the player location is close enough than the enemy should attack. If the enemy is a ranged enemy and  they share the same y coordinate with the player, then the enemy should shoot a bullet in the direction of the player. \\
	The second idea is enemies can have few attacks that can be cycled through against the player. Enemies once within aggression range will move towards the player. Enemy can shoot at the player while moving, and can also start using melee attack cycles when close enough to the player.\\
	The third idea is to have predetermined movement for enemies. Enemies will move in the same direction regardless of the player. \\
